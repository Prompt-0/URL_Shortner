## 2024-07-01 - Avoid cargo fix / cargo clippy --fix
**Learning:** Running `cargo fix` and `cargo clippy --fix` globally can introduce unstable features (like `let_chains`) or modify files outside the scope of a targeted optimization, violating the directive to make ONE small improvement.
**Action:** Only make targeted manual changes for performance improvements. Don't run automated fixers that modify unrelated files. Avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
